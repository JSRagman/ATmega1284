# ATmega1284
Functions, Definitions, and Macros for the Atmel ATmega1284 MCU.

Also, basic functions and definitions for driving a Newhaven Display NHD-0420CW OLED Character Display module.
## Purpose
If you see a function here that you like, take it, it's yours. This is not really meant to be an installable software package, even though all of it has been built and tested.

Note: The word "tested" means that a function was built, run, and behaved as expected. Nothing exhaustive.
## Tools
- Atmel Studio 7
- AVR Dragon
## Status
- The test circuit has been built
- TWI functions have been tested
- Display functions have been tested
## Comments
- Struggling with assembly language style and organization. I'll let you know when I reach enlightenment.
- Deep breath. Count to 8.
