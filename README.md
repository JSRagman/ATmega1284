## Status
Work in Progress... Functions are being added daily.

Ok. Maybe not exactly daily. In my dad's memorable phraseology, I'm slower than the 7-year itch. If you are really anxious to see how it turns out, you might drop me a note.

Code in this repository has been handled with care but not tested. This message will change when testing is complete.

## Comments
So, I says to myself "Hey, this code is ready to go". But the thought that somebody else just *might* see it causes me to give it another look over. Oh my. So, the code is not ready to go after all.

It will be soon. Trust me on this.
