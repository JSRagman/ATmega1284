# ATmega1284
Functions, Definitions, and Macros for the Atmel ATmega1284 MCU
## Status
Work in Progress... Functions are being added ~~daily~~ ~~often~~ every now and then.
Code in this repository has been handled with care but not tested. This message will change when testing is complete.
## Comments
### Constant Definitions
Many constant definitions here are placed at the top of the file in which they are used.
In the actual project, all (ok, almost all) definitions are placed in atm1284pConstants.asm.
### Constant Definitions, Reconsidered
You know, I think it might be better to consolidate all the constant definitions here, as well as in the actual project.
### Macros
I use macros heavily when a project is getting started and pushed into shape. As the project matures, macros are gradually eliminated unless they provide a serious readability benefit.
