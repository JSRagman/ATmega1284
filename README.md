## Status
atm1284pTWIFuncs.asm has some issues. Corrections forthcoming.

Work in Progress... Functions are being added ~~daily~~ ~~often~~ every now and then.
Code in this repository has been handled with care but not tested. This message will change when testing is complete.
## Comments
### Macros
I use macros heavily when a project is getting started and pushed into shape. As the project matures, macros are gradually eliminated unless they provide a serious readability benefit.
### Function Labels
When a project is in the early stages of growth, I go bonkers in fully qualifying function labels and constant names. When everything is settled and in place, I will give them a good haircut.
