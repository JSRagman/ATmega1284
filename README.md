## Purpose
If you see a function here that you like, take it, it's yours. This is not really meant to be an installable software package, even though all of it has been built and tested.

Note: The word "tested" means that a function was built, run, and behaved as expected. Nothing exhaustive.
## Tools
- Atmel Studio 7
- AVR Assembler
- AVR Dragon
## Status
- Updated 21Sep2019
