# ATmega1284
Functions, Definitions, and Macros for the Atmel ATmega1284 MCU
## Purpose
If you see a function here that you like, take it, it's yours.

This is not really meant to be an installable software package, even though all of it has been built and tested.
## Tools
- Atmel Studio 7
- AVR Dragon
- Bandaids
- Bottle of aspirin
## Status
- The test circuit has been built
- TWI functions have been tested
## Comments
- Deep breath. Count to 8.
- To facilitate testing, I've written a whole boatload of functions to drive the Newhaven Display NHD-0420CW OLED character display. They will be added. Soon.
